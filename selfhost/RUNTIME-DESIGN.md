# Runtime & extern strategy for the native (Stage 2.4) backend

How Medaka's 71 `extern` primitives (declared in [`../stdlib/runtime.mdk`](../stdlib/runtime.mdk),
implemented natively in [`../lib/eval.ml`](../lib/eval.ml)'s `primitives` table)
get realized once the tree-walking interpreter is replaced by a bytecode VM
(Stage 2.2) and then LLVM (Stage 2.4). This is the contract the native runtime
must satisfy and the per-extern disposition for building it.

See [`STAGE2-DESIGN.md`](./STAGE2-DESIGN.md) for the backend-architecture decision
(bytecode-VM-first) and [`../PLAN.md`](../PLAN.md) "North star → Stage 2".

## 1. The thesis: "what language" is the *secondary* axis

The natural first question is "C or Rust for the runtime helpers?" — but that
choice is downstream of, and largely reversible relative to, three things that
actually constrain the design. The 71 externs are not one kind of thing; sorting
them by *coupling to the runtime* (not by implementation convenience) collapses
most of the apparent difficulty:

- **~15 are single LLVM instructions** and should never be a runtime call at all.
- **~3 take Medaka closures** (sorts, array builder) — the only ones where an
  FFI callback boundary appears, and the reason to *avoid* native helpers for them.
- **~2 are structural over any value** (`hash`, `inspect`) — the only ones that
  would force runtime value-layout reflection, and the reason to push them into
  the typeclass system instead.
- **The rest (~50)** are leaf operations — scalar/string formatting, unicode,
  syscalls, RNG — pure or effectful but with no callback and no value reflection.
  These are easy in *any* native language.

So the language decision only meaningfully applies to that last bucket, and there
it is **per-helper and reversible**. The architecture is decided by §2.

## 2. The three real constraints — decide these first

These are expensive to retrofit; everything else follows from them.

### 2a. Value representation + GC allocation entry point
`PLAN.md` commits to **Boehm (conservative) GC first**. Boehm is a C library and
scans the C stack conservatively. The consequence that dominates the extern design:

> **Any extern that *returns* a Medaka value must allocate it in the GC heap with
> the correct object header — it cannot hand back a native-allocated buffer.**

`stringConcat` can't return a Rust `String`; `arrayCopy` can't return a Rust
`Vec`; `Ref` can't return a `Box`. They must call *your* `gc_alloc` and write
*your* object layout. So the runtime boundary is **C-ABI over raw pointers** no
matter what language implements the body — the ergonomic native types live
*inside* a helper, never *across* its interface. Pick the uniform value
representation (tagged word? NaN-boxing? boxed-everything?) **before** writing any
helper, because every entry in the LEAF/GC buckets below is a function of it.
**The proposal — with a recommendation — is now §8;** the spike has data.

### 2b. Closure ABI
Three externs invoke a Medaka function (`arraySortBy`/`arraySortInPlaceBy` take a
comparator, `arrayMakeWith` takes a builder). A native helper for these must call
back into compiled Medaka through the C ABI, which couples the runtime to the
**closure representation** (env pointer + code pointer) and the calling
convention. This coupling is avoidable (see §4, `→MEDAKA`) and should be avoided.

### 2c. Structural reflection
`hash : a -> Int` and `inspect : a -> <IO> Unit` traverse arbitrary values. The
*only* way to keep the native runtime free of value-layout reflection (RTTI, tag
dispatch on every field) is to not have these as reflective externs at all — route
them through the typeclass machinery you already have (see §4, `→METHOD`).

### Sequencing note
**Prototype this entire extern ABI at the bytecode-VM stage (§2.2), not at LLVM.**
The VM already forces a commitment to value representation, a C-ABI extern
boundary, and a closure layout — and it is gated **byte-for-byte against the
tree-walker oracle** per slice (`diff_selfhost_eval*.sh`). So the whole runtime
strategy gets validated in the cheap setting, with a trusted reference, before any
native code generation exists. By 2.4 the ABI is already proven and the VM becomes
a *second* oracle for the native backend.

## 3. The disposition taxonomy

| Tag | Meaning |
|-----|---------|
| `INTRINSIC` | Emitted inline by codegen (one or few LLVM instructions); **no runtime call**. |
| `LEAF` | Small pure native helper, C-ABI; allocates any output via `gc_alloc`. Language is free choice (C default). |
| `UNICODE` | A `LEAF` whose logic is unicode classification/case-mapping — the one place **Rust earns its keep** (a `unicode-*` crate beats hand-rolled tables). Still C-ABI, output copied into the GC heap. |
| `IO` | Native syscall wrapper (effectful). Any language; Rust pleasant. |
| `RNG` | Native, holds RNG state across calls. |
| `GC/CTRL` | Native, intimate with the allocator / unwinder / trap path. **Must** be hand-written against the runtime internals. |
| `→MEDAKA` | **Not a native helper.** Rewrite in Medaka, compiled by our own backend — so the Medaka callback never crosses an FFI boundary. |
| `→METHOD` | **Not an extern.** Convert to a derived/dispatched typeclass method, eliminating runtime value reflection. |

## 4. The hard cases, in detail

**Sorts & array builder (`arraySortBy`, `arraySortInPlaceBy`, `arrayMakeWith`) →
`→MEDAKA`.** A native `sort_by` wants a native comparator; ours is a Medaka
closure. A native helper would have to marshal the array to a raw `*mut Value`,
wrap a trampoline that re-enters compiled Medaka per comparison through the C ABI,
and allocate the result through the GC — i.e. `unsafe` raw-pointer code in which
Rust's `Vec`/`sort_by`/safety all evaporate at the boundary. Writing the sort *in
Medaka* (a standard mergesort/introsort over `Array`, compiled by our backend)
keeps it one calling convention end-to-end, allocates through the normal path, and
is validated by the existing differential harness for free. Same argument for
`arrayMakeWith` (the `Int -> a` builder is a Medaka closure). **This is the lever
that removes the FFI-callback problem entirely.** (They are native in the
tree-walker only because OCaml's `Array.sort` was conveniently at hand.)

**`hash : a -> Int` → `→METHOD`.** Note `==`/`compare`/`debug` are already
typeclass methods (`Eq`/`Ord`/`Debug`), not externs — they monomorphize /
dictionary-pass at compile time. `hash` is the lone structural straggler. Make it
a derived **`Hashable`** method (same `deriving` machinery as `Eq`), so per-type
hash code is *generated*, not computed by a runtime that walks an unknown layout.
Net effect: **the native runtime needs zero knowledge of value layout** — it only
ever sees opaque pointers and scalars.

**`inspect : a -> <IO> Unit` → `→METHOD` + `IO`.** It's both reflective *and*
effectful. Decompose: render via the `Debug` method (compile-time dispatched) to a
`String`, then `putStr` it. No reflective extern remains.

**`Ref` / `set_ref` → `GC/CTRL`.** `Ref` allocates a one-slot mutable cell in the
GC heap; `set_ref` is a store. Under Boehm both are trivial (plain store, no
barrier). If a later precise/generational GC replaces Boehm, `set_ref` grows a
**write barrier** — isolate it now so that change is one function.

**`panic` / `exit` / `__fallthrough__` → `GC/CTRL`.** `panic` prints to stderr and
aborts (or unwinds, if you ever want catchable panics — decide the unwind model
when you pick the calling convention). `exit` is `IO`-tagged but is really a
process-control primitive. `__fallthrough__` is compiler-internal (raised on a
non-exhaustive match the checker couldn't rule out) — lower it to the same trap as
`panic` with the standard "non-exhaustive match" message.

**Strings & `stringLength` — representation-dependent.** If Medaka strings are
stored UTF-8 with a cached codepoint count, `stringLength` is `INTRINSIC` (header
read); if codepoint count is computed on demand it is `LEAF` (O(n) scan). Likewise
`charCode` is `INTRINSIC` only if `Char` is a 32-bit codepoint. **Lock the string
representation in §2a and revisit the two rows tagged `(rep)` below.** Medaka is
codepoint-aware (per `runtime.mdk`), so favor a representation that keeps codepoint
length and indexing cheap.

## 5. Per-extern disposition (all 71)

### Disposition totals
`INTRINSIC` 12 · `LEAF` 19 · `UNICODE` 9 · `IO` 16 · `RNG` 5 · `GC/CTRL` 5 ·
`→MEDAKA` 3 · `→METHOD` 2  = **71**.

After applying `INTRINSIC` (no call), `→MEDAKA` (compiled Medaka), and `→METHOD`
(typeclass), the **actual native runtime is ~54 leaf functions** — and every one
is C-ABI over opaque pointers/scalars with **no callbacks and no value-layout
reflection**.

## 6. Language recommendation for the native surface

- **`LEAF` / `IO` / `RNG` / `GC/CTRL`:** **C is the frictionless default** — Boehm
  is C, the boundary is C-ABI, the GC/`gc_alloc`/header code is C-shaped. Choose
  Rust per-helper where its internal logic is non-trivial and self-contained
  (parsing, `listDir`, RNG), but expose `#[no_mangle] extern "C"` over raw
  pointers and copy any output into the GC heap. The choice is **reversible
  per-function**, so don't over-invest in it up front.
- **`UNICODE`:** prefer **Rust** (`unicode-*` crates) — materially better than
  hand-rolled C tables, and the inputs/outputs are scalars/owned strings that copy
  cleanly into the GC heap.
- **Do not** reach for Rust expecting `Vec`/`HashMap`/`sort_by` "for free" — they
  cannot cross the C-ABI/GC boundary; that intuition does not transfer (this is
  exactly why the sorts are `→MEDAKA`).

## 7. Open decisions to lock before building the runtime

1. **Uniform value representation** (tagged word / NaN-box / boxed) — gates every
   `LEAF` row and the two `(rep)` rows. (§2a) **Proposal + recommendation in §8.**
2. **String representation** — UTF-8 + cached codepoint count vs. other; gates
   `stringLength`/`charCode` intrinsic-vs-leaf and all string `LEAF`/`UNICODE`
   helpers. (§4)
3. **GC**: Boehm-first is decided; confirm the `gc_alloc`/object-header contract
   and whether `set_ref` needs a barrier now or later. (§2b)
4. **Closure ABI & calling convention** — needed for `→MEDAKA` sorts to call their
   comparator, and for the unwind model behind `panic`. (§2b)
5. **Where the ABI is first proven**: at the **bytecode VM (§2.2)**, against the
   tree-walker oracle — not at LLVM. (§2 sequencing note)

All five are exercised by the bytecode VM before any native runtime exists, so the
cheap, oracle-backed setting is where they should be settled.

### 8.0 What the value set actually is (the constraints)

The native rep must encode every runtime value kind the tree-walker has
(`lib/eval.ml`'s `Value` / `selfhost/eval.mdk`'s `Value`), effects erased:
**immediate-ish scalars** — `Int`, `Float`, `Char`, `Bool`, `Unit`; **heap
aggregates** — `String`, `Tuple`, `List`, `Array`, ADT (`VCon`), `Record`, `Ref`,
closures; and the laziness cell `VThunk` (letrec / recursive values). Three facts
dominate the choice:

1. **Medaka's `Int` is already 63-bit.** It *is* OCaml's `int`: `intMaxBound =
   4611686018427387903 = 2^62 − 1`, `intMinBound = −2^62` (verified on the binary).
   Every Medaka program already assumes a 63-bit `Int`. So a rep that spends **one**
   bit on a tag and keeps 63 for the integer is **lossless** — it changes no
   observable behaviour. Any rep that gives `Int` *fewer* than 63 bits (e.g.
   NaN-boxing's 48–51) is a **semantic regression**.
2. **`Float` is a full 64-bit IEEE double.** A 64-bit word holds a full `Int` *or* a
   full `double`, never both *plus* a tag. Something has to give for floats; which
   thing differs per option below. (The spike confirmed this physically: floats are
   the one slice-1 value it had to heap-allocate — `CLit (LFloat _)` is the only
   node that calls `@mdk_alloc`.)
3. **GC is conservative first (Boehm).** `PLAN.md` commits to Boehm before any
   precise GC. Conservative scanning of the C stack/heap interprets any word that
   *looks like* an aligned heap pointer as a live reference. This **couples the rep
   to GC correctness** and is the single most decision-changing constraint — it is
   what eliminates the otherwise-attractive NaN-box (see 8.2).

Also load-bearing, and already decided elsewhere in this doc: `hash`/`inspect` are
`→METHOD` and `Eq`/`Ord`/`Debug` are typeclass methods (§2c, §4). So **the runtime
never reflects on an opaque value's layout** — type-directed behaviour is resolved
at compile time. That is what lets the rep get away with *not* self-describing
every value (see the Bool-vs-Int note in 8.4).

### 8.1 Option A — Uniform tagged word  *(RECOMMENDED)*

A value is one 64-bit machine word. The low bit discriminates:

- **low bit 1 → immediate.** The other 63 bits are a signed integer. `Int`, `Char`
  (codepoint), `Bool` (0/1), `Unit` (0), and **nullary data constructors** (`None`,
  `Nil`, `True`, an enum's tag index) are all immediates — *no allocation*.
  Untag = `ashr 1`; tag = `(x << 1) | 1`. This is exactly OCaml's own scheme.
- **low bit 0 → pointer.** An 8-byte-aligned pointer to a heap cell (whose low 3
  bits are therefore 0). `Float`, `String`, `Tuple`, `List` cons, `Array`,
  `VCon`-with-fields, `Record`, `Ref`, closures, thunks all box.

The heap cell carries a **one-word header** (a small layout/tag id + field count)
followed by the fields (each itself a word). The spike boxes `Float` as exactly
this: `{ i64 header, double }`.

**Why this wins for Medaka, concretely:**
- **Lossless `Int`** (fact 1) — the entire reason it beats NaN-box. 63-bit ints are
  *the* hot value in a compiler workload (the self-host source is integer- and
  pointer-heavy; floats are rare).
- **Conservative-GC-friendly** (fact 3) — immediates are *odd*, so Boehm never
  mistakes an `Int`/`Char`/`Bool` for a pointer; real pointers are genuine aligned
  pointers Boehm tracks natively. No hidden pointers, no displacement tricks. This
  is the property NaN-box cannot offer under Boehm.
- **Nullary constructors are free** — `None`/`Nil`/enum tags never allocate, a real
  win for the `Option`/`List`/`Result`-heavy stdlib.
- **Proven** — it is what the spike runs, and it is OCaml's battle-tested scheme,
  so the reference interpreter and the native backend share an integer model.

**Cost:** every `Int` arithmetic op pays a shift to untag and a shift+or to retag
(visible in the spike's emitted IR — that visibility is deliberate). Two mitigations
make this a non-issue *without* changing the uniform rep: (a) at `-O`, LLVM folds
much of the tag arithmetic across a chain of ops (the tags cancel); (b) because
Medaka is statically typed and monomorphizable, a later pass can keep `Int`/`Float`
**unboxed in locals/loops** (carry a native `i64`/`double` through a hot region,
tag/box only at boundaries) — an optimization the uniform rep permits but does not
require. The standing `Float`-always-boxes cost is the real one; see 8.4.

### 8.2 Option B — NaN-boxing  *(rejected as the primary rep)*

Encode every value inside a 64-bit double: real doubles are themselves; everything
else hides in the payload of a quiet NaN (the 51-or-48 spare bits carry a tag +
pointer/immediate). Floats are *free* (no box); the trade is that pointers/ints live
in NaN payloads.

**Two disqualifiers for *this* project, in priority order:**
1. **It fights conservative GC (fact 3) — the dealbreaker.** A heap pointer hidden
   in a NaN payload is stored as `0x7FFA_<48-bit-ptr>`, not as a clean aligned
   pointer. Boehm scanning that stack/heap word sees the NaN bit-pattern, **not** the
   pointer → it will not mark the pointee → use-after-free. NaN-boxing effectively
   *requires a precise GC* (or fragile interior-pointer/displacement hacks). We
   committed to Boehm-first; NaN-box would force precise GC up front — the exact
   "decision-dense, expensive" work Stage 2 defers.
2. **It regresses `Int` (fact 1).** A NaN payload gives ~48–51 bits, so `Int`
   becomes 48-bit — a silent narrowing of a type every existing program assumes is
   63-bit. Either accept the regression (changes semantics) or box big ints (adds a
   branch to *every* int op) — both worse than Option A's uniform shift.

NaN-boxing is the right call for a *float-dominated, precisely-GC'd* dynamic language
(it's why some JS engines use it). Medaka is int/pointer-dominated and Boehm-first —
the tradeoff points the other way. Revisit only if (a) a precise GC lands *and* (b)
profiling shows float boxing dominates.

### 8.3 Option C — Boxed-everything  *(rejected; kept as the correctness floor)*

Every value, including `Int`, is a heap pointer to a tagged cell. Conservative GC
becomes trivially correct (every word is a real pointer), and there is no tag
arithmetic. But an `Int` per allocation is catastrophic for an integer-heavy
workload — allocation and GC pressure on the hottest value. Rejected for perf.

It is worth naming because it is **what the spike's `Float` path already is** (a
boxed scalar) and what a first-cut bytecode VM can use unchanged: it is the
zero-risk fallback if a tagged-word bug ever needs bisecting. Correctness floor, not
a destination.

### 8.4 Recommendation & the questions it leaves for ratification

**Adopt Option A (uniform tagged word, OCaml-style: low-bit-1 immediate `Int`,
boxed pointers).** It is lossless for Medaka's 63-bit `Int`, conservative-GC-safe
under Boehm, frees nullary constructors, and is already proven by the spike. NaN-box
is rejected primarily because it breaks conservative GC and secondarily because it
narrows `Int`; boxed-everything is the correctness floor, not the rep.

Decisions this still leaves open (the human-ratified part):

- **Heap header.** Include a one-word header on boxed cells now (the spike does), or
  omit under Boehm (which tracks size itself) and add it when precise GC lands?
  Recommendation: **include it** — 8 bytes/object buys an easy precise-GC migration
  and a fallback generic `Debug`, and it is cheap relative to the allocation it
  rides on.
- **`Float` unboxing.** Ship floats boxed (Option A baseline) and add type-directed
  local unboxing later, or invest in unboxed `Float` from day one? Recommendation:
  **boxed first** — floats are rare in the bootstrap path; unbox only if profiling
  says so. (This is the one row where NaN-box would have helped — record it.)
- **`Bool`/`Int` indistinguishability.** Under Option A a `Bool` and the `Int` 0/1
  share a bit-pattern. The spike handles this by choosing the print routine from the
  *static* type — fine because slice 1 is monomorphic and `Debug` is `→METHOD`
  (compile-time dispatched, §2c). Ratify that **the rep is not required to
  self-distinguish scalar types** — generic rendering goes through compile-time
  `Debug`, never runtime reflection. (If a future feature needs runtime scalar
  reflection, that is when a header tag on a boxed scalar, or a distinct `Bool`
  immediate tag, earns its keep.)

### 8.5 Calling convention sketch (commit: `musttail` for tail calls)

The uniform-word rep makes the convention fall out cleanly:

- **Uniform word ABI.** Every compiled Medaka function takes and returns the 64-bit
  value word. An arity-*n* function is `T @f(T %a0, … , T %a{n-1})` with `T = i64`.
  Medaka's multi-arg lambdas are **true n-ary** (`x y => body`, *not* curried — see
  AGENTS.md), so a function has a fixed arity; partial application builds a closure
  (PAP) rather than currying through one-arg trampolines.
- **Two calling conventions, one boundary.** Medaka↔Medaka calls use a
  **tail-callable convention** (`tailcc`); Medaka↔runtime-extern calls use the **C
  convention** (`ccc`) — the C-ABI-over-opaque-pointers boundary §2a/§6 already
  commit to. The runtime never sees `tailcc`; compiled code marshals to `ccc` at the
  extern call (the spike already does this: its `@mdk_print_*` / `@mdk_alloc` calls
  are plain C-ABI).
- **`musttail` for syntactic tail calls — committed.** Medaka leans on deep
  non-accumulating recursion (the unary `isEven`/`isOdd`, `foldl`, the tree-walker's
  own recursion); without guaranteed TCO it would stack-overflow where the
  tree-walker does not. Emit LLVM **`musttail`** on every call in tail position.
  `musttail` requires the caller and callee to share calling convention and return
  type and for the call to be immediately followed by `ret` — and the **uniform
  i64-in/i64-out ABI satisfies the signature-match constraint for free** (every
  Medaka function is `i64(…)→i64`). That synergy is a second, independent reason the
  uniform word pays off: it is precisely what makes universal `musttail` legal. Use
  `tailcc` to also get TCO on calls LLVM can't mark `musttail` (e.g. through a
  function-pointer/closure where the convention still matches).
- **Closures.** A closure value is a boxed cell `{ header, code_ptr, captured… }`;
  calling loads `code_ptr` and passes the closure (env) pointer as a leading
  argument. (Out of scope for the spike — flagged here as the next rep decision the
  *bytecode VM* should pin down per §2 sequencing, before LLVM.)
- **`panic`/`exit`.** `noreturn` (§4). The unwind model (abort vs. catchable
  unwind) is deferred with the convention, as §4 already notes.

**Where this gets proven.** Per the §2 sequencing note, the rep + convention should
be exercised at the **bytecode VM (§2.2)** against the tree-walker oracle before the
real LLVM backend — the VM forces the same value-representation and C-ABI-extern
commitments in the cheaper, single-steppable setting. This spike is the *earliest*
such exercise (LLVM-side, scalar-only); the VM will broaden it to the full value set
(aggregates, closures, thunks) with the same oracle.
